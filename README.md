## 💡 Introduction
A Django-based web application for tracking and categorizing personal expenses, built with a PostgreSQL database and structured following MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture. The project includes a comprehensive test suite with integration and smoke tests. CI/CD pipelines implemented via GitHub Actions. 

## 🚀 Features
- Registration of private user accounts
- Authentication and access control for personalized dashboards
- Budget creation with custom categorization and limits
- Adding and tagging expenses across multiple budget categories
- Interactive expense analytics and monthly summaries
- Django admin panel for managing users, categories, and transactions

## ⚡ Quick Start
⚠️ Note: Before you begin, make sure you have Git and Docker (≥27.5) installed on your machine. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is optional.

Follow the CMD steps to run the app locally with Docker:
##### 1. Clone the repository
```git clone <https_or_ssh_repo_address>```

##### 2. Navigate to the project directory
```cd Expense_tracker_with_CICD/```

##### 3. [Optional] Switch to WSL
```wsl```

##### 4. [Optional] Generate proper SECRET_KEY 
In case you need to run the app with DEBUG=False mode please generate the key in python console with the following command (previous local Django installation needed!):
```
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
print(get_random_secret_key())
```

##### 5. Start the app with docker-compose
```docker compose -p <your_project_name> up -d```

##### 6. Open the app in your browser
http://localhost:8000/

##### 7. Log in using a guest account
- username: ```guest123```
- password: ```guest123```

##### 8. [Optional] Clean-up
```
docker-compose -p project down -v   # To close the app/containers
docker images                       # To get image ids
docker rmi <image_ids>              # To remove images
```
