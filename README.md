## üí° Introduction
A Django-based web application for tracking and categorizing personal expenses, built with a PostgreSQL database and structured following MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture. The project includes a comprehensive test suite with integration and smoke tests. CI/CD pipelines implemented via GitHub Actions. 

## üöÄ Features
- Registration of private user accounts
- Authentication and access control for personalized dashboards
- Budget creation with custom categorization and limits
- Adding and tagging expenses across multiple budget categories
- Interactive expense analytics and monthly summaries
- Django admin panel for managing users, categories, and transactions

## ‚ö° Quick Start
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Before you begin, make sure you have Git and Docker (‚â•27.5) installed on your machine. WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is optional.

Follow the CMD steps to run the app locally with Docker:
##### 1. Clone the repository
```git clone <https_or_ssh_repo_address>```

##### 2. Navigate to the project directory
```cd Expense_tracker_with_CICD/```

##### 3. [Optional] Switch to WSL
```wsl```

##### 4. [Optional] Generate proper SECRET_KEY 
In case you need to run the app with DEBUG=False mode please generate the key in python console with the following command (previous local Django installation needed!):
```
from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key
print(get_random_secret_key())
```

##### 5. Start the app with docker-compose
```docker compose -p <your_project_name> up -d```

##### 6. Open the app in your browser
http://localhost:8000/

##### 7. Log in using a guest account
- username: ```guest123```
- password: ```guest123```

##### 8. [Optional] Clean-up
```
docker-compose -p project down -v   # To close the app/containers
docker images                       # To get image ids
docker rmi <image_ids>              # To remove images
```

## üß™ Tech Stack
